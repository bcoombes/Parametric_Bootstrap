Coombes BJ, Biernacka, JM. 2017. In preparation

Description: 
Provides a method to correct inflated type I error for Gamma (and Fisher's) method in a gene-set GE interaction analysis.

Requirements:
Downloaded parallel R package from CRAN (optional)
Downloaded GMMAT R package from https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/software.html#gmmat

Notes:
This code tests GE interaction at the gene-level using the PC method. Users may use other gene-level tests by substituting
their function where lrtest.GE() is in the code.
